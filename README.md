# React.js Project: Advitya'24 Web

ðŸŽ‰ Welcome to my latest React.js project! This project is a fusion of design and functionality, inspired by my work for Advitya'24 during the Meraki Club's UXquisite Hackathon.

## Overview

- **Technology Stack:** React.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Optimization:** Currently optimized for desktop screens; responsive version in progress
- **Bugs:** A few friendly critters are being dealt with

## Design Process

This project brings together various dependencies and open-sourced components tailored to my preferences. I harnessed the power of Tailwind CSS for styling and React.js for dynamic functionality.
The Design inspiration was my own and was created on Figma. The Elements were slightly changes according to my preference for the Login and Sign up page but the Design for the main components was made constant.
